\section{The DOL file format}
The DOL file format is the format of the main executable for both GameCube and Wii games. There is a header in the file describing how the executable is laid out. The file consists of a header, up to 7 code sections and up to 11 data sections. The values in the header are all 32 bit, big endian values. The header is structured as follows: \cite[\href{https://wiibrew.org/wiki/DOL}{\texttt{DOL}}]{WiiBrew}

\section{The Apploader}

GameCube games don't come as simple DOL executables, but rather they are disk images. The executable and the data is extracted by the IPL (Internal Program Loader). The IPL reads some data from the disk, information on where the relevant apploader functions are, and then repeatedly calls these until all the data is read.
